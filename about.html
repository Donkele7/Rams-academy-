    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Kelebogile Ramotebele, founder of Rams Academy, started the academy in 2025 after witnessing how poverty and crime robbed many talented children of their potential. Inspired by his own experiences, he assembled a team of passionate individuals to create a sanctuary of hope for young footballers.
    </p>
    <p>
      With only donated footballs and a group of eager kids, Rams Academy quickly became more than a training ground. It grew into a movement that nurtures future leaders through mentorship, meals, safe transport, and professional-level coaching ‚Äî all for free.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>‚úÖ Provide coaching that turns passion into talent</li>
      <li>‚úÖ Teach discipline, teamwork, and leadership</li>
      <li>‚úÖ Offer free kits, meals, and transport to all players</li>
      <li>‚úÖ Keep kids away from crime and give them purpose</li>
      <li>‚úÖ Build a stronger community through unity and growth</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
      We believe football is more than a game ‚Äî it‚Äôs a tool for transformation. Our dream is to establish a national-level academy that creates future stars and better citizens. Whether they become professionals or not, every child leaves Rams Academy ready to face the world.
    </p>
